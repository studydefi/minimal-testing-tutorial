# minimal-testing-tutorial

Demonstrates testing off a fork of Mainnet. More details here: https://studydefi.com/testing-on-mainnet/

## Setup

After cloning and running `npm install`, you'll need a Mainnet node and a private key (any will do).

You can get one from Infura or a pseudo-archive node from https://moonnet.now.sh/

Run the tests with `npx jest`.
